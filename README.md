# Mechatronics Recuit Repo
This repository will contain all the projects that the recruits will be working on. This repo serves as a way for the rest of the software team to view and analyze your problem solving abilities and to understand how you approached the problem.

In this repo ever recruit will have their own branch in which they can work on Their projects. Please do not just use someone elses code for your own project, we will be able to tell if you just copy-pasted someone elses work. Also please do not try to modify someone else's branch as we will see the commit and know exactly what you have changed.

 - Project Proposal 1
     - Basic Requirement
